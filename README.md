## 🔍 Project Overview

1. **Problem Statement**  
   Predict the number of bike rentals per hour based on environmental factors (e.g., temperature, humidity, wind) and temporal features (e.g., date, hour, season).

2. **Dataset**  
   A cleaned dataset containing:
   - Date-time fields: timestamp, year, month, hour, day of week, season.
   - Weather features: temperature, humidity, windspeed, weather condition.
   - Target: bike rental counts (`count`, `casual`, `registered` if available).

3. **Author's Goals**  
   - Explore data through EDA
   - Preprocess features and encode temporal and categorical variables
   - Train and compare regression models  
   - Evaluate performance using metrics like RMSE and R²  
   - Visualize results and prediction vs. actual rental counts

## 🧪 Notebook Highlights

- **Data Loading & Cleaning**  
  Load CSV, parse date-time, check for missing values or outliers.

- **Feature Engineering**  
  Extract year/month/hour/weekday. Encode categorical variables. One-hot encode seasons or weather categories if needed.

- **EDA & Visualizations**  
  Visual plots showing:
  - Bike count distribution over time
  - Relationship between rentals & weather factors
  - Time-based patterns (i.e., peak hours)

- **Model Training & Evaluation**  
  Trained regression models like:
  - LinearRegression, DecisionTreeRegressor
  - RandomForestRegressor, XGBoostRegressor, etc.  
  Evaluated using RMSE and R², comparing results across models.

- **Prediction vs. Actual Plot**  
  Scatter or line plot between predicted and actual rental numbers.

## 🛠 How to Run This Project

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/navneetshukla17/bike-sharing-project.git
   cd bike-sharing-project
Setup environment:
pip install -r requirements.txt
Launch the notebook:
jupyter notebook bike_sharing_analysis.ipynb
Execute the notebook from start to finish. Visual outputs and model results will be generated inline.
📈 Dependencies
pandas, numpy — data handling
matplotlib, seaborn — visualization
scikit-learn — model training and evaluation
Optional: xgboost, lightgbm — for advanced tree-based models
🎯 Results & Next Steps
Best-performing model demonstrated strong predictive performance (describe RMSE/R² here, once known).
Potential next steps:
Cross-validation for model robustness
Time-series forecasting with lag features
Geo-spatial analysis (if station location data is available)
